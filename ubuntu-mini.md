## UbuntuMini.iso Install Guide:

<li>By default the Ubuntu minimal .iso will only boot with a legacy BIOS. So im going to show you how you can get a UbuntuMini.iso on a UEFI system so we can install a minimal Ubuntu setup for REMnux. For this to happen we must build our own ISO using the Ubuntu minimal ISO, and a Ubuntu Server ISO.<br> Through my research on this, I came across a script on <a target="_blank" href="https://noobient.com/2019/06/25/ubuntu-18-04-uefi-network-installer/">Noobient</a>
<br>
<li>First lets create a temp directory for our work:<br>
                            <code>$ mkdir /tmp/remnux</code></li>
                        <li>Next we will create a file for our script: (You can call this whatever you'd like, I personally just named it customiso.sh)<br>
                            <code>$ touch customiso.sh</code></li>
                        <li>Lets copy the script into the customiso file, then make it executable. You can use whatever text editor you would like. I will be using vim in this example.<br>
                            <code>$ vim customiso.sh</code></li>
                        <br>
                            <div class="cpy" title="Copy Code to Clipboard"><i class="icon small"></i><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -eu

server_iso='ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64.iso'
mini_iso='mini.iso'
dist_dir='ubuntu-20.04-netinstall'

if [ ! -e ${server_iso} ]
then
    wget "https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-legacy-server/releases/focal/release/${server_iso}"

if [ ! -e ${mini_iso} ]
then

mv ${dist_dir}-tmp/install/hwe-netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz ${dist_dir}/initrd.gz
zip -r ${dist_dir}.zip ${dist_dir}
</code></pre>
                        <code>$ chmod +x customiso.sh</code>
                        <li>Run the script:<br>
                        <code>$ ./customish.sh</code></li>
                        <li>Now if you do a <code>ls</code> you will see three new files and a two new directories. The two important files to verify are <code>ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64.iso</code>, <code>mini.iso</code>, and a the new directory called <code>ubuntu-20.04-netinstall</code>.</li>
                        <li>Time to verify the sha of your .iso files. to do this run the <code>sha256sum</code> command on both files:</li>
                        <pre><code>$ sha256sum mini.iso
0e79e00bf844929d40825b1f0e8634415cda195ba23bae0b041911fde4dfe018  mini.iso
$ sha256sum ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64.iso 
f11bda2f2caed8f420802b59f382c25160b114ccc665dbac9c5046e7fceaced2  ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64.iso
</code></pre>
                        <li>Now its time to make a custom ISO using the <code>mkisofs</code> command. If you do not have the command. You can download <code>cdrtools</code> through your package manager.</li>
                        <li>What I did was run<br>
                        <code>$ mkisofs -o ubuntu-20.04-netinstall.iso \ </code> <br> and this should give you a prompt to run the rest of the commands:</li>
                        <pre><code>&gt; -b ubuntu-20.04-netinstall/isolinux.bin \
&gt; -c ubuntu-20.04-netinstall/boot.cat \
&gt; -no-emul-boot \
&gt; -boot-load-size 4 \
&gt; -boot-info-table -J -R -V \
&gt; UbuntuMinimal .
</code></pre>
                        <li>After completing the previous step, you should now see another file in your directory called <code>ubuntu-20.04-netinstall.iso</code>.</li>
                        <li>We now need to burn this iso onto our USB drive. Lets verify the name of our USB stick first with:</li>
                        <pre><code>$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0     1G  0 part /boot
├─sda2   8:2    0    30G  0 part /
└─sda3   8:3    0 900.5G  0 part /home
sdb      8:16   1  14.6G  0 disk
</code></pre>
                        <li>Be careful to make sure you recognize the proper block device name for your USB. In the picture above my USB is listed as <code>sdb</code>. If you are unsure what the block device name of your USB stick is called, you can run the <code>lsblk</code> command without the USB inserted in your PC and compare the differences to see what NAME is added.</li>
                        <li>Lets actually burn the ISO onto our USB now using the command <code>dd</code>.</li>
                        <br>
                        <strong>WARNING: YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OS IF YOU TYPE IN THE INCORRECT BLOCK DEVICE NAME</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <code>$ dd bs=4M if=ubuntu-20.04-netinstall.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress
</code>
                        <li>Once this is completed it's now time to boot your USB stick. I am going to assume you are installing REMnux onto another device. So lets plug in the USB stick into a USB port on the device you'd like to install Ubuntu on.</li>
                        <br><b>DISCLAIMER: I am going to assume that you have the knowledge about setting your boot order, and GRUB, so a few steps here will be skipped.</b>
                        <li>
                            When I personally plugged in my USB I was getting an error that my PC could not find a bootable device when my USB stick was set to #1 in my boot order. I seen that this was not an issue with other people trying to boot a minimal Ubuntu iso with UEFI. If you are having the same issue as me, and already have grub installed, go back into your BIOS and set GRUB as #1 in your boot order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you see Grub pop up, depending on what is on your screen you will need to do a few steps differently
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Personally I previously had Arch installed on this device so I type in <code>c</code> to get to the grub terminal. If this is the case. We will need to type in a few commands to get the Ubuntu Installer to run. First lets list our devices.
                        </li>
                        <code>grub&gt; ls</code><br>
                        <li>Depending on your previous setup and partitions this could look a bit differnt. In my case my output of <code>ls</code> looked like this:</li>
                        <code>(hd0) (hd1) (hd1,gpt3) (hd1,gpt2) (hd1,gpt1) (hd2)</code><br>
                        <li>If you are not positive on which device is your USB, once again you can unplug your usb device. Load up the grub terminal and perform a <code>ls</code> and see what device is missing. Pay close attention to the devices listed with <code>,gptX</code> in them as they can give you a hint. For example if I remove my USB and perform a <code>ls</code> my output would look like this:</li>
                        <code>(hd0) (hd0,gpt3) (hd0,gpt2) (hd0,gpt1) (hd1)</code><br>
                        <li>As you can see the <code>hdX</code> number changes based on the order its listed and not the actual device itself. I can see that when my USB stick in inserted it is listed as <code>(hd0)</code> since the <code>hdX,gptX)</code> devices change numbers, and the trailing (hdX) also changes numbers. So now lets boot into our Ubuntu install:</li><pre><code>grub&gt; set root=(hd0)
grub&gt; linux /ubuntu-20.04-netinstall/linux
grub&gt; initrd /ubuntu-20.04-netinstall/initrd.gz
grub&gt; boot</code></pre>
                        <li>This will bring up the Ubuntu Installer. To finish the remnux install I will direct you to the <a target="_blank" href="http://Remnux.org">Remnux.org</a> website as they already have a detailed writeup on the correct steps to take.<br>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/install-from-scratch">Remnux Docs</a></li>
